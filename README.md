1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

## Synopsis
The data was obtained from the database of National Weather Service which contained natural events and their effects on the United States from 1950 to 2011. The data and the documentation are available from the course website of Data Science Specialization on Coursera. Only data from 1996 were considered as previous years did not record all types of events. Out of the initial 902297 observations, 201313 observations were considered which were recorded after 1996 and had positive number of fatalities, injuries, property damage, or crop damage. The analysis showed that tornadoes caused the most injuries whereas excessive heat caused the most fatalities. Furthermore, droughts caused the most amount of crop damage and floods caused the most property damage.
